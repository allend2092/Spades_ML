Great to hear that the game bots are now able to play a complete game! To apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) for training your neural network, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Define the Reward Structure**: As previously discussed, you need to define a reward structure that aligns with the objectives of the game. For instance, you can assign rewards for winning hands, matching bids, and scoring points.

2. **Collect Data During Gameplay**: As the game progresses, collect data on the states, actions, and rewards. Each time a bot makes a decision (like making a bid or playing a card), record the state vector, the action taken, and the subsequent reward received.

3. **Training Loop**: Implement a training loop where the neural network is updated based on the data collected. This typically involves adjusting the weights of the network to maximize the expected rewards. In PyTorch, this is done using an optimizer like Adam or SGD.

4. **Loss Function**: Define a loss function that measures the difference between the expected reward and the actual reward received. A common choice in RL is the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss.

5. **Backpropagation and Weight Update**: Use backpropagation to compute gradients and update the network's weights. This is where the network learns from its experiences.

6. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Implement a strategy to balance exploration (trying new actions to discover their rewards) and exploitation (using known actions that yield high rewards). A common strategy is ε-greedy, where the bot randomly explores with probability ε and exploits with probability 1-ε.

7. **Training Episodes**: Train the network over multiple episodes of gameplay. Each episode is a complete game from start to finish. The network should gradually improve its performance as it learns from its experiences.

Here's a simplified outline of how you might structure the training loop:

```python
for episode in range(num_episodes):
    reset_game()  # Start a new game
    total_reward = 0

    while not game_over:
        state_vector = get_current_state()
        action = bot.make_decision(state_vector)
        next_state, reward = play_action(action)
        total_reward += reward

        # Store state, action, reward for training
        memory.store(state_vector, action, reward, next_state)

        # Train the network
        if len(memory) > batch_size:
            states, actions, rewards, next_states = memory.sample(batch_size)
            update_network(states, actions, rewards, next_states)

    print(f"Episode {episode}, Total Reward: {total_reward}")
```

In this loop, `memory` is a data structure (like a replay buffer) that stores experiences for training. `update_network` is a function that performs the backpropagation and weight update steps.

Remember, RL, especially in a complex environment like a card game, can be challenging and may require tuning and experimentation to get good results. You'll need to experiment with different reward structures, network architectures, and training parameters to find what works best for your game.
