Class and Function Definitions: Your class and function definitions are well-structured. The CardDeck, Player, HumanPlayer, BotPlayer, and other utility functions are clearly defined and serve distinct purposes.

Game Initialization: The main function does a good job of initializing the game, creating players, shuffling the deck, and dealing cards.

Game Loop: The main_game_loop function is set up to iterate through players and handle their actions. This is a good structure for turn-based games.

Team Assignment: The assign_teams function effectively randomizes and assigns players to teams. This is a good approach to ensure balanced and varied gameplay.

Suggestions for Improvement:
Difficulty Level in BotPlayer: You're passing a string 'hard' as the difficulty level for BotPlayer. Ensure that this parameter is utilized in the BotPlayer class, perhaps in the make_bid method or other strategic decisions.

Game Conditions Class: The game_conditions class name should follow the CamelCase naming convention, becoming GameConditions. Also, ensure that its attributes are utilized effectively in the game logic.

Player Actions: In main_game_loop, you have placeholders for player actions. Flesh out these sections with actual game logic, like making bids, playing cards, and handling user inputs.

End Game Conditions: Implement logic to check for end game conditions in main_game_loop. This could be based on the score reaching a certain threshold or a certain number of rounds being completed.

Error Handling in User Inputs: In functions like how_many_players and how_many_points, consider adding a loop to re-prompt the user for input if they enter an invalid value.

Displaying Cards: In HumanPlayer.display_cards_in_hand, the card display is clear. Consider adding similar functionality for BotPlayer for debugging purposes or to display bot actions during the game.

Code Comments: Your code is generally well-commented, but adding more comments explaining the logic, especially in complex sections, would be beneficial for readability and maintenance.

Refactoring: As your project grows, keep an eye out for opportunities to refactor. For example, if you find repeated code blocks, consider if they can be extracted into a separate function.
